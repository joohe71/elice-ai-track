The sky of seasonal passage 
Is filled with all autumn in the air. 
Without any fearsome discourage, 
I feel I’d count all these stars within autumn's fair.

I wouldn't yet count these stars
Impress’d one by one, deep down in my chest.
For soon the morning nears
And I have full morrow night left.
And, mine youth still has not come to its last.

One star's for memories,
One star's for amour,
And one with loneliness,
One star's for dreams and wonder,
One star's to the poesies,
And one for mother, my mother.

Mother, I'm just whispering pretty words to each star, one after another.
Names of kids shared desks at primary school, foreign girls' names like
Pae, Kyung, Ok. Names of girls who became mothers already, and poor 
neighbors, pigeon, puppy, rabbit, mule, roe-deer, and poets like
 'Francis Jammmes', and ‘Reiner Maria Rilke'.

Ah, they are all so far away
As those stars glitter'ng faintly from afar.
Far-flung  in North Gando, you as well stay
At such a distance, dear Mother.

Longing for some unknown,
On this hill of stars lit by so many,
I wrote my own name down
And then with dirt buried it  away.

In fact, worms must weep all through this even',
For they feel sorrows on their shameful names given.

Yet, when spring comes at last to my star after harsh winter,
When grasses open their sprouts around the tomb
On this hill where my name is buried o'er,
Shall grasses heavily grow as if pride of mine bosom.
